# Introduction

`download_script` is the script designed for accessing, downloading, and decrypting `beiwe` data. It was created by the programmers of Beiwe, Zagaran. This version is `September 2015`.

This script is **not** intended to be a module. Instead, use `ipython` and run it via `%run ./beiwedata/download_script/download_script.py` or your preferred interactive method.

`download_script_credentials.py` will need to be customized by each researcher for their own study with their specific credentials.
